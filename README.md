<h1> Project Introduction </h1>
<p align="juatify">The rock, paper, scissors is a game traditionally played using hand gestures depicting the objects mentioned.
The  game is usually played by two persons and each player will choose an object. Based on their chosen object,
there is a 1/3 chance of winning, losing, or a draw  for every round. </p>

<h1> Project Description</h1>
<p align="justify">A RPS-based game using Java that incorporates elements such as fire, water, and flora(nature)
to add another layer of fun to the game. The players will be granted 10 lives at the start of each game, and it will
then be decremented depending on the outcomes of each round. For each round, the players will choose among the objects
(R,P,S). Then the program will randomly affix a randomized element to imbue their chosen object to raise the odds while
preserving the fairness of the game. After each round, the program will analyze and determine the outcome for that round.
The losing player during the round will be deducted a life or two depending on the fatality of the object of the winning
player. While each player's lives is still greater than zero, the game proceeds. If one of the players lost all of their
lives, the player will be declared as the loser of the match.This game aims to be fun, fair, and encourage users and
developers to move beyond the box. </p>
